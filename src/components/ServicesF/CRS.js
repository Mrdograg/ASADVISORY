What is BIS?

Under the Department of Consumer Affairs, Ministry of Consumers Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution, the Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS) is a national accreditation organisation (or government authority).

What is BIS CRS Scheme?
⦁ The Compulsory Registration Scheme (CRS) was launched in 2012 by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology [MeitY], previously known as the Department of Electronics and Information Technology.

⦁ The MeitY proposed the CRS scheme in conjunction with BIS. As part of this programme, BIS gives mandatory BIS Registration Certificates to makers of electronics and IT products. Without a CRS Registration, no one is permitted to introduce, market, sell, or distribute a product in the Indian market.

⦁ By registering on the basis of a self-declaration of conformity for goods and articles in accordance with Indian Standards, the Bureau of Indian Standards grants a license to use or apply as a Standard Mark with unique R-numbers. The BIS (Conformity Assessment) Regulations, 2018, Scheme II of Schedule II, states that "the grant of a license and its operation under the Compulsory Registration Scheme shall be carried out in compliance with the conformity assessment scheme."

⦁ As per the Orders, no one is allowed to manufacture, keep in stock for sale, import, sell, or distribute products that do not adhere to the Indian standard specified in the Order and do not display the Standard Mark with a unique registration number obtained from the Government.
